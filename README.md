# Coby

Quickly add co-authors to your commit. Great for pairing and excellent for sending a little love/credit to that special someone who helped fix that gnarly bug of yours.

If you are using GitHub Desktop, you can rely on the extension [co-authors](https://desktop.github.com/features/co-authors/)!

## How it works

To add co-authors to a commit, just add one or more “Co-authored-by” trailers to the end of the commit message:

```
Commit message

Co-authored-by: Aloïs de Gouvello <3449303+aloisdg@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: torendil <1529367+torendil@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Include your trailers at the end of your commit message, and have at least one line of white space before them.

You can do it by hand or rely on [Coby](https://aloisdg.github.io/coby/):

## Hacktoberfest

During the Hacktoberfest it is common to have reviewers helping a lot. Since the event seems to forget how their contributions are important to the well being of the project, you can define them as co-author. Happy coding!
